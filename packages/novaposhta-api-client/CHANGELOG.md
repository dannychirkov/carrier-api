- Enhanced `counterpartyService.save()` logic to handle PrivatePerson vs Organization correctly

- README significantly expanded with:
  - Complete examples for all new services
  - Organization counterparty creation examples
  - Full waybill creation workflow from scratch
  - Address search and CRUD examples
  - Reference data retrieval examples

### Fixed
- Added missing JSDoc comment for `limit` field in `GetCargoDescriptionListRequest`
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors with proper type narrowing in counterparty service
- Code formatting improvements with Prettier

### Testing
- Added 18+ new unit tests for CounterpartyService (private person, organization, CRUD operations)
